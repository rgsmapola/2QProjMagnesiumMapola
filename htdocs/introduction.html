			<h3>Introductory Guide to Vocal Synth</h3>
				<p>Vocal Synth is a tool or a synthetic instrument. Like other synths, it is meant as a digital alternative for equipment that is inaccessible or impractical. For example, a keyboard instead of a 

				grand piano, or drum synths in your computer instead of a drum set. Vocal Synths strive to be an alternative to an in-person singer. There are a range of synths in different price ranges. They are 

				created by singing syllables and sounds in different (sometimes just one) pitches. The collection of the voice files with those recorded sounds is called a "voice bank". Many companies create a 

				character and have someone record voice files for them. These characters can range from almost completely blank to one with a full personality. They have gathered a large fan base, culture, and 

				history differently than other musical synthesizers.</p>
					<br>
				<p>They are more appealing to producers for many reasons. Vocal Synths cost less, and even nothing. The social awkwardness of having to find a singer, talk to them, negotiate rates, work out a 

				schedule,ask them to sing a certain way, and etc. are eliminated, because the producer themself does the work alone. They can manipulate the vocals to sing whatever and however they'd like. This 

				does mean that most of the heavy work will fall on the producer. However, it is not unheard of for many people to work on one song. A producer may do only one thing or everything. It's also been 

				discussed in the community how there are programs and synths that are easier to work with than others. Most of the time, companies release voice demos and free versions which offer just enough for 

				you to decide whether you'd like to purchase the synth or not.</p>
					<br>
				<p>Typically, Vocal Synths songs are in Japanese, since it is the language that Vocal Synths are most commonly produced in. However, more synths of other languages are being developed and released. 

				Other producers also opt to make the synth sing another language anyway. It's difficult, but it's very possible and can sound good. One of these producers is KIRA. They are quite a popular producer 

				and they've released many well-known and good songs. They also created the song "Highlight" for Miku Expo 2021 Online. It's an upbeat and fun song talking about how we're still connected during 

				this time. The last few sentences may have you wondering, "Who is Hatsune Miku?"</p>
					<br>
				<p>Hatsune Miku is one of the, if not the most, popular Vocal Synths of all. Her voice was provided by Saki Fujita and she was released on August 31, 2007. She has bright blue hair tied in two 

				ponytails, one on each side of her head. She's commonly seen in songs, merchandise, collaborations, etc. One could say she's the face of Vocal Synth. She has a young feminine voice, but she can 

				derive from it if the producer pleases. There have also been appends, or alternative versions, released. They make it easier for producers looking to use a certain tone of Miku's voice.</p>
