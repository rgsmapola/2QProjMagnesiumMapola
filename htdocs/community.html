			<h3>A Community-run Industry</h3>
				<p>The Vocal Synth industry is very involved with its community. Designs of some mascots were even voted upon by fans and is sometimes fan-designed. Snow Miku, a version of Miku endoresed during 

				winter seasons, has a yearly design that is created and voted on by fans. It wouldn't stop companies from doing whatever they'd like, but it does prevent them from doing so. Many enjoy the 

				relationship between fans, vocal synths, and their companies. Since they can say and sing words that can be understood by people, they have a different reception than other musical synthesizers. 

				They're marketed and showcased differently. People feel as if their love is being reciprocated.
				</p>
					<br>
				<p>In addition to the companies interacting with the audience, the fans themselves interact amongst themselves. Fans create the songs, and many merchandise is fan-made. I personally enjoy how the 

				community creates a chain of inspiration just by creating and enjoying content. A producer could create a song, then an artist could create an artwork inspired by it, and a beginner artist could be 

				inspired by them, and so on. It even goes outside of the community. Many people make friends, get business deals, and improve their skills in the space. Artists and producers can get support from 

				companies by being commissioned to create work for their events and merchandise. It's a great place to be in.
