			<h3>Vocal Synth is Magical while Catastrophic</h3>
				<p>Just like every community, the Vocal Synth fan base has their own share of problems. Ranging from petty fights to companies ruining their synths, there's a lot of chaos that goes on.
				</p>
					<br>
				<p>Since many Vocal Synths are blank slates, many people will have their own version of them in their heads. Unfortunately, this means that there are other people who would get angry at other people for not thinking the same as them. Though Vocal Synths have mascots with their own designs, some artists prefer not to draw a part of that outfit, or draw them in a different outfit altogether. This could be for any reason, such as not knowing how to properly draw it yet, or just not wanting to include it. There are people who make negative comments about this to artists. This happens not only to clothing deisgn, but to a myriad of things, such as skin colour, hair length, eye colour, hair colour, height, etc. Cosplayers and producers can't escape these types of comments as well. It's very disheartening to creators and could even prevent them from sharing their work online. If there's nothing wrong with their content, you should scroll if you just don't like it.
				</p>
					<br>
				<p>There are many art contests in the space, hosted by fans or the company themselves. It's a great way to get recognition. However, some people copy, trace, and steal other's art and submit it as 

				their own. Unfortunately, art thieves are very rampant in the internet. There has been many cases where the art thief had the stolen, traced, and/or tampered art work featured in music videos, 

				contests, mascot design contests, etc. It's morally wrong and disrespectful. Artists spend so much time perfecting their work. Some artists have deactivated their accounts or deleted their artwork from the internet just to stop the thieves from getting it. It's very important to ask for permission to use someone's work and credit them properly. 
				</p>
					<br>
				<p>Many people have started putting credits whenever they use someone's work, and more people are now asking others to do so. It's great to see appreciation not just for someone's art, but also to 

				their hard work and skill that have gone into their work. It's refreshing to see this even more these days and I hope that it increases more in the future.
