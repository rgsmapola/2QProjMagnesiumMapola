			<h3>The Rabbit Hole of Vocal Synth Merchandise</h3>
				<p>Merchandise is a great way to show your love and support to your favorite franchise. It's a physical representation of your love and it's great for decorating spaces. However, there are so many kinds of merchandise that it's confusing. Where should you start?
				</p>
					<br>
				<p>Here I'll be showing you different kinds of decorative merchandise that you can get! (All photos are mine)
				</p>
					<br>
				<p>Figure
				</p>

				<p>These are very popular amongst many fan bases! They're made of different materials, mostly resin and PVC, and they range from affordable prize figures to expensive scale figures. They take up the most space out of all the merchandise in this article. People put them on their tables, cabinets, or shelves. Some of them, like prize figures, require a bit of assembly. There are also figures like Nendoroid or Figmas which you can change parts and poses. They're very fun to collect and it's amazing to see an illustration get translated into something physical.
				</p>
					<br>
				<p>Acrylic Standees
				</p>

				<p>These are pieces of acrylic with the illustration printed on them, with an acrylic stand. You insert the tab at the bottom of the piece in the slot in the acrylic stand. They're very pretty and acrylic allows for different kinds of finishes. Most of them have protection film that you peel.
				</p>
					<br>
				<p>Keychains
				</p>

				<p>Keychains are well-known by everyone. Their materials are mostly rubber or acrylic. It's great when you want to take your merchandise with you!
				</p>
					<br>
				<p>Pins
				</p>
					<img src="..\images\kaimeipins.jpg" title="KAITO and MEIKO pins from KaiMei zine (Twitter: @kaimeizine)" alt="KAITO and MEIKO pins from KaiMei zine (Twitter: @kaimeizine)"></img>
				<p>Pins can be your regular button pins, or they could be made in enamel! They're great for bags, lanyards, jackets, and others!
				</p>
					<br>
				<p>Stickers
				</p>
					<img src="..\images\kaimeistickers.jpg" title="KAITO and MEIKO stickers from KaiMei zine (Twitter: @kaimeizine)" alt="KAITO and MEIKO stickers from KaiMei zine (Twitter: @kaimeizine)"></img>
				<p>These are great when you'd like the art on your items! People put them on laptops, journals, notebooks, etc. There are many finishes and materials for them. Some people, like myself, prefer to collect stickers than use them. They're affordable and don't take up space!
				</p>
					<br>
				<p>Zines/artbooks
				</p>
					<img src="..\images\kaimeizine.jpg" title="KAITO and MEIKO zine from KaiMei zine (Twitter: @kaimeizine)" alt="KAITO and MEIKO zine from KaiMei zine (Twitter: @kaimeizine)"></img>
				<p>Zines and artbooks can be fanmade or official! Zines are fanmade and mostly for charity. They feature drawn and written art and almost always have merchandise with them.
